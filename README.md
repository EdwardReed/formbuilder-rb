========

Formbuilder.rb is a [Rails Engine](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) that's designed as a compliment to [Formbuilder.js](https://github.com/dobtco/formbuilder), a library that lets your users create their own webforms inside of your application.

Since Formbuilder.rb is a fairly non-trial piece of software, it's important to understand its components and how it works:

1. We add `ResponseField`, `EntryAttachment`, and `Form` models to your application.  (Each type of response field (text, checkboxes, dropdown, etc.) uses [STI](blog.thirst.co/post/14885390861/rails-single-table-inheritanceâ€Ž), inheriting from the `ResponseField` model.)
3. You `include Formbuilder::Entry` in an existing model.
4. We add a few classes to help you render forms and entries.

*Note: All Formbuilder models and classes are namespaced within the `Formbuilder` module.*

If you have a few moments, consider reading the source, especially the Rails app in `spec/dummy`, as it should give you a good idea of how Formbuilder integrates.

### Requirements

**Postgres is currently required.** See [Issue #1](https://github.com/dobtco/formbuilder-rb/issues/1).

[Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) and [Rmagick](https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick) for file uploads.
[Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) to geocode address fields.


### Installation
#### 1) In your Gemfile
`gem 'formbuilder-rb', require: 'formbuilder'`

#### 2) Create the migrations for the Formbuilder models
1. `rake formbuilder:install:migrations`
2. `rake db:migrate`

#### 3) The `Entry` model gets mixed in to an existing model in your application

*Note: you will need to have either the `responses` attribute or the `responses_text` attribute on your Entry model.*

```ruby
#  responses       :hstore
#  responses_text  :text

class Entry < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Formbuilder::Entry
end
```

#### 4) Associate a form with an existing model (optional)
```ruby
class MovieTheater < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :form, as: :formable, class_name: 'Formbuilder::Form'
end
```

### Usage

#### Render a form
```erb
<%= Formbuilder::FormRenderer.new(@form, @entry).to_html %>
```

#### Save an entry
```ruby
@entry = Entry.new(form: @form)
@entry.save_responses(params[:response_fields], @form.response_fields) # validates automatically
```

#### Validate an entry
```ruby
@entry.valid?
# => false

@entry.error_for(form.response_fields.first)
# => "can't be blank"
```

#### Integrate with the [Formbuilder.js](https://github.com/dobtco/formbuilder) frontend
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :forms, only: [:update]

# app/controllers/forms_controller.rb
class FormsController < ApplicationController
  include Formbuilder::Concerns::FormsController
end
```
